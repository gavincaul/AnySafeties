# AnySafeties
A website I am building that is used to track safeties in the NFL. More details in the about HTML file.

Built in PyCharm, thus using python.
Website was designed and built by me using Flask.
Safeties are live tracked for each game through the use of selenium(web scraping tool), but I do plan on changing to scrapy instead.
