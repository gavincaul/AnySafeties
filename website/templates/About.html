    About the page and me.

<div style = "position:fixed; left: 215px; width: 1000px; text-align:center;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;">
    <p>The idea for this page began with my five friends and our fantasy football league. We wanted to create something different about this league, separate it from the rest. A few ideas flew in the air, until one person suggested that safeties be worth 20 points!
     Typically, safeties are worth a mere two points, but making them 10x the value made us look for every possibility of a safety. Thus, to keep
     us from constantly searching, I decided to build this website to do the searching for us.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The website works through the use of python based webscraping, constantly checking each NFL game per week to see if there
     is a safety in one of the games. If there is, the website will say what game(s). It resets at the beginning of each NFL week.

        My name is Gavin Caulfield, the creator of AnySafeties.com. I am a student at University of Delaware, trying my best to learn
        computer science. I am a self taught 'webscraper' and website builder. My main goal for this website was for all my friends to keep
         track of the safeties, so if the minimalist/barebones (and I mean BAREBONES) approach throws you, know that I simply just don't feel the need
        to put such detail into a website that has one purpose; to tell me if there was a safety!

    <p>I am a very broke college student, and this website costs money, so please feel free to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=JD7RGYFDXQTQW&no_recurring=0&item_name=Please+donate+to+keep+the+website+going
